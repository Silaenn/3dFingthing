<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">3D Tekken Clone ðŸŽ®</h1>

Welcome to the Tekken Clone project! This is the repository where I study and develop Tekken inspired 3D fighting games. This project aims to create a fun fighting experience with basic mechanics such as combos, animations and dynamic gameplay. ðŸš€

<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">Features âœ¨</h1>
3D Environment: Immersive battleground arena with realistic terrain and props. <br>
Player Mechanics: Basic player controls, including movement, and combat. <br>
AI Opponents: Enemy characters with simple behavior patterns for engaging battles. <br>
Health System: Players and enemies have a health bar that depletes upon taking damage. <br>
Weapons System: Equip and use weapons to attack enemies. <br>


<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">What I'm Learning ðŸ“š</h1>
Setting up a 3D environment in Unity. <br>
Implementing character movement and physics. <br>
Creating and animating player and enemy models. <br>
Developing combat mechanics (e.g., melee or ranged attacks).<br>
